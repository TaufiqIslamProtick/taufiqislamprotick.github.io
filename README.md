## Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

### Time Series Forecasting on FAO Pesticide Dataset

[GitHub](https://github.com/TaufiqIslamProtick/pesticide-data-analysis)

- Developed an ARIMA model for forecasting the g/Int$ value (grams of pesticides used for a single dollar revenue from agriculture) using historical data from 1990-2021.

### BERT Score Comparison of Three NLP Models on Product Review Summarization

[GitHub](https://github.com/TaufiqIslamProtick/text-summarizer)

- Developed a text summarization system using BART, PEGASUS, and T5 models on 1000 Amazon reviews, evaluated using BERTScore with results showing varying levels of semantic similarity (BART: 0.906, PEGASUS: 0.9059, and T5: 0.84).

## Research Projects

### Leverage an LLM to Mine Security and Privacy Concerns in Online Product Reviews

- Leveraged the generative power of an LLM to automate the task of reading and analyzing product reviews to elicit concerns.

### A Qualitative Analysis build to elicit Security and Privacy Concerns from Online Product Reviews

- Designed a three-step coding process to analyze online product reviews to elicit security and privacy concerns from online product reviews.

### Analysis of a Simple Low-cost Intervention's Impact on Retention of Women in Computer Science

- Designed a crosswalk for instructors' ease in sending simple low-cost intervention messages to women in collegiate level CS courses. Prepared questionnaire in Qualtrics for gathering survey responses.

### Time-Series Cluster Analysis of Students' Learning Progression in a Game-based Learning Environment, ENGAGE

- Partition students into clusters based on the time series data which are performance traces of middle school students in an interactive game-based learning platform named ENGAGE.

### Gaining Insights into Programming Comprehension through Cluster Techniques

- Utilized Java's AST library to look at Java code patterns of correct and incorrect submissions of Java quizzes.

### Predicting Secondary Structure of Proteins with Neural Networks

- Utilized an unweighted and a weighted voting method with four models: RaptorX-Property, SPIDER2, Porter 4.0, and Jpred4 to predict the secondary structure of proteins.
